Port of Long Beach: Sustainability Analysis with Cesium Photorealistic 3D Tiling and ArcGIS Pro 3.2

Welcome. This project looks at The Port of Long Beach and uses Cesium. 

Background 

This project was inspired by my MA in Urban Planning at USC Price School of Public Policy and my interest in ports has extended into my MS in Human Security & Geospatial Intelligence at USC Spatial Sciences Institute. 

Technically, I learned a lot during this process. Among them are the Cesium Community, GitHub respositories and ChatGPT 4 are all helpful. However, ChatGPT 4 can take you down some wrong rabbit holes so do not depend on it alone. In general it can be helpful if you have some broken code that you need examined to help you troubleshoot to fix it. Among the resources I found helpful, especially if you are new to JavaScript, are the series of JavaScript for Beginner YouTube videos from Microsoft Developer. I also wasn't clear about 'install npm' when I started and that it required Node.js to be installed on my computer. That is foundational to making anything with JavaScript work. I mentioned that for any novices so you don't get tangled with that step. I'd count myself as a fellow novice when I began but have learned so much through this process that I am now quite comfortable developing anything in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For beginners, Control+F5 and Control+F12 (for Windows) will be your best friend as I often struggled with cache and broken code issues and those functions helped to reset the cache and identify errors respectively.
